- 👋 Hi, I’m @NotFiona
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things to list!  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Raspberry Pi programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I'm currently working on... or propose an idea to me! :)
- 📫 How to reach me: unless this gets bigger, messaging me through here is my filter for spam.  Thanks!
